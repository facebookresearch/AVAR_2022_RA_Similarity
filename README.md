# Towards the prediction of perceived room acoustical similarity
## THIS REPOSITORY IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Supplementary material to the paper _Towards the prediction of perceived room acoustical similarity_ published at _AES AVAR 2022_

# Contents of this repository

- Multichannel Room Impulse Responses (RIR) from the paper (sampling rate 192 kHz). These are measured with the [RL-R Audio open array](https://github.com/facebookresearch/BinauralSDM#microphone-arrays) and can be rendered using the [Binaural SDM repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/BinauralSDM).
- Summary table of the room acoustical parameters of the RIRs used in the experiment. (upcoming)
- Binaural RIRs (BRIR) for several head orientations rendered using Binaural SDM. (upcoming)
- Example scripts to render the multichannel RIRs into BRIRs. (upcoming)
